In this project I tried to create a blockChain system as close as possible to a real blockChain for educational purposes.
This mini project is still being improved so certain parts have been reduced (especially on Miners and sequence of actions)

Before starting to read the classes, I will explain to you some fundamental concepts in economics and cryptography
which will help you better understand what the blockchain represents.

    Ledger:

    To understand what a blockchain is, it's important to first explore the concept of a "ledger".

    A ledger is a register in which several transactions occurring over time are recorded.
    Each transaction records a transfer of value, including a sender, a recipient, the amount transferred, and a timestamp.

    The ledger is public within the blockchain network (see [Proof of Work] (link to PoW explanation) for more details on network participants) and immutable.
    This means that anyone can observe the transactions taking place there, although the identities of the participants are often anonymized (we will see how this works later).

    In the context of a blockchain, this ledger is implemented in the form of blocks, each linked to the previous one. A block is made up of:

    - a list of transactions
    - a hash of the previous block (see [Hashing and SHA-256](link to explanation))
    - a timestamp
    - and a proof of work ([Proof of Work](link to PoW explanation))

    Hashing and SHA-256 :

    To understand a key concept of blockchain, it is essential to understand what a "hash" is.
      A hash is a unique fingerprint generated from a given piece of information, whether it is a word, a number, or even an entire file.
      It transforms this information into a fixed-length character string, regardless of the size or type of the original information.
      In this project, I use the java.security API to access hashing algorithms, including SHA-256.
      The latter produces a string of 64 hexadecimal characters, representing the digital fingerprint of the information.
      This hashing process is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always give the same hash,
       but it is virtually impossible to find the original input from the hash alone.
      Additionally, even a tiny change in the original information produces a completely different hash.


    RSA encryption :

    RSA is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm primarily used for signing transactions in blockchain systems.
     The private key allows the owner to sign a message, while the public key is used to verify the signature's authenticity.


    _1 What is a blockchain ?

        Historically, blockchain was designed to solve problems related to centralized banking infrastructures.
          Before that, ensuring the integrity of a financial system required trust in a central authority that managed financial information.
          This model lacked transparency and was vulnerable to corruption or possible internal problems.

        Blockchain was conceived as a decentralized system to ensure that transactions are both transparent (all transactions are publicly visible)
          and secure (Thanks to cryptography, especially digital signatures)
          without relying on a central authority.
        Overall it is represented as follows:
          - A block is a collection of transactions that are cryptographically linked to the previous block through a "hash," forming a chain.
          - A transaction represents the exchange of UTXOs between two wallets, moving funds from one person to another.
          - UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) are the remaining amounts from a previous transaction that have not yet been used in a new transaction.
             Each UTXO is associated with a public key which identifies the owner of the funds.

         Miners verify the cryptographic signature to ensure that the transaction was authorized by the rightful owner of the private key associated with the UTXO.
          In systems like Bitcoin, miners also compete to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate new blocks and earn rewards.

        For instance, when Alice wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Bob, she creates a transaction that references Bob's public key.
          A UTXO is created that shows Bob received 1 Bitcoin, and Alice's UTXO is marked as 'spent'.
          The Miner checks if Alice's UTXO is available and has not been spent, if it's valid the UTXO is deleted from the register and Bob new UTXO is added.
          The Miner check the signature and if it's valid the transaction is added to the block.

         In Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin, Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to secure the blockchain by ensuring that each block requires computational effort,
         making it difficult to alter past transactions.
         The first one to solve it gets to add a new block to the blockchain, which is then validated by the network participants.

         In short, the blockchain represents a public database.
